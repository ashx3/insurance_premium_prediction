    based on their attributes and health conditions. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of their life 
    rather than the ineffective part. Insurance policies are being charged based on the person's age and medical conditions.
    To use the app, the user has to select the relevant options below to generate results. The generated results are predicted by the model
    which is already trained with the data of past insurance holders with their medical conditions. After entering the information,
    the app generates an estimate of the medical expenses that the user will incur.''')
